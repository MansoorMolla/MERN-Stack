function outer(){
    const x = 1;
    function inner(){
        const y = 2;
        console.log('X and y value add is ', x+y);
    }
    inner()
}
outer()







function outer(x){
    function inner(y){
        console.log('The sum of x and y is :',x+y);
    }
    return inner
}

const add = outer(5)
const res = add(4)


Why do we return inner? When we call outer(5), we want to get a function that adds 5 to any number. That function is inner. So we return inner from outer.
What happens if we don’t return inner? If we don’t return inner, then outer(5) doesn’t give us anything useful. We can’t use it to add 5 to a number.
Why don’t we return outer? outer is a function that creates other functions. If we returned outer, then outer(5) would give us a function creator, not a function that adds 5 to a number.
What are add and res? add is the function that outer(5) gives us. It’s a function that adds 5 to any number. res is the result of calling add(4), which is 9.
Let’s use a simpler analogy:

Think of outer as a cake mold and inner as the cake. When you use the mold (outer) with some ingredient (x), it gives you a cake (inner). Now, this cake has a special property - it can add its own flavor (x) to any other flavor (y) you give it.

If you don’t return the cake (inner), you won’t have anything to taste. If you return the mold (outer), you’ll just have another mold, not a cake.

When you do const add = outer(5), it’s like making a cake with flavor 5. Now add is a cake that can add flavor 5 to any other flavor. When you do add(4), it’s like adding flavor 4 to your cake, so you get a cake with flavor 9 (res).


🔐 Why Call It "Private"?
Even though function scope already hides variables, closures allow us to preserve and control access to them.
✅ With closures, we can decide how the outside world interacts with the variable!

❌ Without Closure (Direct Modification)
let count = 0; // Public variable

function increment() {
    count++;
    console.log(count);
}

increment(); // 1
increment(); // 2
count = 100; // ❌ Anyone can change it!
console.log(count); // 100 (No control)
🔴 Problem: count is fully exposed and can be modified by anyone.




✅ With Closure (Private & Controlled)

function createCounter() {
    let count = 0; // Private

    return {
        increment: function () {
            count++;
            console.log(count);
        }
    };
}

const counter = createCounter();
counter.increment(); // 1
counter.increment(); // 2
counter.count = 100; // ❌ No effect (variable is private)
console.log(counter.count); // undefined (private)

✅ Now count is private, and only increment() can modify it!
🔥 Conclusion: What Closures Give Us That Normal Functions Don't?
Normal function variables disappear after execution.

Closures keep variables in memory (they stay "alive").

Closures allow controlled access (read/write but not direct modification).

They provide true private variables in JavaScript (which the language itself doesn't have natively).

// 1️⃣ Hoisting with var (Only Declaration is Hoisted)
console.log(a); // ✅ undefined (Declaration hoisted, but not the assignment)
var a = 10;
console.log(a); // ✅ 10

// 2️⃣ Hoisting with let (Temporal Dead Zone - TDZ)
try {
    console.log(b); // ❌ ReferenceError: Cannot access 'b' before initialization
} catch (error) {
    console.log(error.message);
}
let b = 20;
console.log(b); // ✅ 20

// 3️⃣ Hoisting with const (Also in TDZ)
try {
    console.log(c); // ❌ ReferenceError: Cannot access 'c' before initialization
} catch (error) {
    console.log(error.message);
}
const c = 30;
console.log(c); // ✅ 30

// 4️⃣ Function Declaration (Fully Hoisted)
sayHello(); // ✅ Works! Output: "Hello, World!"
function sayHello() {
    console.log("Hello, World!");
}

// 5️⃣ Function Expression (Not Hoisted)
try {
    greet(); // ❌ TypeError: greet is not a function
} catch (error) {
    console.log(error.message);
}

var greet = function () {
    console.log("Hi!");
};
greet(); // ✅ Works now! Output: "Hi!"

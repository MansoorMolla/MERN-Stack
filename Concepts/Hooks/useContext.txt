if we want to pass data from parent component to child component, suppose imagine we have parent component
and child1, child2, child3, child4 component 
and if we want to pass data from paraent component to child4 component we need to use prop drilling concept 
which is passing data through all component that is from parent to child1, child2, child3, then child4

but to avoid these nested passing and prop drilling we have a concept of useContext or context api

in these we no need to pass data through all component suppose if we want to pass data from parent to child4
then we can directly pass from parent to child4 no need to pass through all children 


steps to implement these 

1 we have a method createContext() need to import it from react and it will return a object
write these outside component beacuse we need to export it 

export const context = useContext();

2 and the returned object context have a method inside it that is Provider and that passing has to be written inside it 
and it has default prop value that is to pass data has to given inside value 

<context.Provider value={anything that you want to pass}> <Home /> </ context.Provider>

3 import these exported context in which child only you want to use these data, and main thing we have main method or hook
useContext() import these and inside these method pass that returned object name

useContext(context) and these method will return the data which is passed to it so assign these to some varaible 

const data = useContext(context);


passes data through the component tree without prop drilling
useful for global or shared state that multiple component needed


const value = useContext(MyContext);

MyContext: the react context object created with React.createContext

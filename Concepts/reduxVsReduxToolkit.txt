Sure, let's discuss the differences between **React Redux** and **Redux Toolkit**:

1. **Boilerplate Code**: Redux requires a significant amount of boilerplate code to set up a store, reducers, and actions¹. Redux Toolkit simplifies and modernizes Redux development with minimal boilerplate code¹.

2. **Immutability**: In Redux, you need to make sure your reducers are pure functions and don't mutate the state directly¹. Redux Toolkit allows you to write mutable state updates in reducers, which are converted to immutable state updates behind the scenes using a library called Immer¹.

3. **Action Creation**: In Redux, you need to define action types and action creators separately¹. Redux Toolkit auto-generates actions from the reducers themselves using Autodux¹.

4. **Middleware**: Redux Toolkit comes with Redux Thunk middleware configured out-of-the-box¹.

5. **Developer Experience**: Redux Toolkit is more beginner-friendly and provides a streamlined development experience⁴.

6. **Performance**: Redux Toolkit is designed to provide better performance out of the box¹.

In summary, while Redux and Redux Toolkit are both valuable tools for state management in React applications, Redux Toolkit offers a more beginner-friendly and streamlined development experience⁴. The choice between them should be guided by your project’s specific requirements and your familiarity with Redux⁴.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions. 😊
